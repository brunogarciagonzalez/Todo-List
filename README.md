This is a guided project being completed along-side video
lessons found in the Practical JavaScript course at:
[ https://www.watchandcode.com ]

The guided project is structured so that a ToDo list is improved upon
along-side progressing in the course, divided into instructional
sections, which each lead to a version of the project/ ToDo list.

The outlook of the project is based on the application found at:
